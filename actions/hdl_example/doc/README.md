## Hardware Details
The following block diagrams show an overview of main blocks interconnections.

On the following diagram we have the top view showing:
- FPGA pins, connected to PCIe and to configuration flash memory (this directly depends on card schematic and is included in the card PSL_DCP file, see [../../../hardware/README.md](../../../hardware/README.md#snap_env))
- the PSL block (providing PCIe interface and flash controller)
- the action wrapper block

The following diagram details the interconnection between the PSL (which is external to psl_accel), the SNAP core and the action wrapper.
