* Provides a simple base allowing to discover how to exchange ***single precision floating points (float) or double precision floating points (double)*** between the application on server and the action in the FPGA.
* C code is multiplying 3 decimal numbers read from host memory and writing result in host memory
* Detailed documentation is available at : <https://opencapi.github.io/oc-accel-doc/actions-doc/hls_decimal_mult/>
